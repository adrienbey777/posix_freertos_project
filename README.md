## FreeRTOS Exploration on POSIX

This repository contains my experiments with the internal mechanisms of FreeRTOS, executed via the POSIX port. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of the kernel (scheduling, synchronization, inter-task communication) in a Linux environment, without relying on embedded hardware.

# Contents

- Task creation and management (priorities, scheduler behavior).

- Use of mutexes and semaphores for synchronization.

- Testing queues and notifications for inter-task communication.

- Timer manipulation and exploration of FreeRTOS hooks.

- Porting and execution via POSIX threads.

# Project Highlights

- Practical understanding of real-time concepts.

- Experience with synchronization and inter-task communication mechanisms.

- Ability to work with FreeRTOS without specific hardware, thanks to the POSIX port.

- Development in C on a Linux environment.

# Technologies

- FreeRTOS (POSIX port)

- C

- CMake

- Linux

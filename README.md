# FreeRTOS Exploration on POSIX

This repository provides an in-depth study of the internal mechanisms of the FreeRTOS kernel using its POSIX port, enabling the analysis of the kernel’s operation in a Linux environment. It focuses on core kernel features, including scheduling, synchronization primitives, and inter-task communication, enabling analysis and experimentation in a Linux environment without the constraints of embedded hardware.

## Contents

- Task creation and management (priorities, scheduler behavior).

- Use of mutexes and semaphores for synchronization.

- Testing queues and notifications for inter-task communication.

- Timer manipulation and exploration of FreeRTOS hooks.

- Porting and execution via POSIX threads.

## Project Highlights

- Practical understanding of real-time concepts.

- Experience with synchronization and inter-task communication mechanisms.

- Ability to work with FreeRTOS without specific hardware, thanks to the POSIX port.

- Development in C on a Linux environment.

## Technologies

- FreeRTOS (POSIX port)

- C

- CMake

- Linux
